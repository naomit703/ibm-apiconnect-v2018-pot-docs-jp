# Lab 1 - Introduction to IBM API Connect
In this lab, you’ll gain a high level understanding of the architecture, features, and development concepts related to the IBM API Connect (APIC) solution. Throughout the lab, you’ll get a chance to use the APIC command line interface for creating LoopBack applications, the intuitive Web-based user interface, and explore the various aspects associated with solution’s configuration of RESTful based services as well as their operation.

---
# Lab 1 - Objective 
In the following lab, you will learn:

+ How to create a simple LoopBack application
+ How to create a Representational State Transfer (REST) API definition 
+ How to test a REST API
+ How to publish an API to the Developer Portal

---
# Lab 1 - Case Study Used in This Tutorial
In this tutorial, you will create the default Hello World LoopBack application. We will look at the created artifacts to get a better understanding of what is created for you. The hello-world application is a simple RESTful service that holds a set of "notes" in memory. In this lab we may be creating a new RESTful service and API, but in future labs you'll be creating APIs with existing services.

---
# Lab 1	- Before You Begin
For this lab, you will be using a VMWare image running Xubuntu that is pre-installed with the API Connect Developer Toolkit. Ensure the image is up and running before starting. If you have any questions, please consult your lab instructor.

---
# Lab 1	- Step by Step Lab Instructions

# 1.0 - Update Host Image

1. The Xubuntu host image may require a quick patch to update some support scripts. To run the update script, launch the terminal emulator application:
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/open-terminal.png)

1. In the terminal, type:

	```bash
	update-pot -v 5010 -c patch -c labs - c consumer -c services
	```
	
1. The update pulls down a clone of our git repo and moves the support files to the proper locations. The update will take a few minutes, please be patient while the update completes.

# 1.1	- Creating a `notes` Application

1.	We will use the API Connect Developer Toolkit command line interface to create the initial application and explore the created artifacts.

1.	From the terminal command line type:

	```bash
	apic loopback
	```
	
	This command starts the application generator, Yeoman, to help scaffold the new project. Just press enter for each of the three questions.
	
	```
	     _-----_
	    |       |    .--------------------------.
	    |--(o)--|    |  Let's create a LoopBack |
	   `---------´   |       application!       |
	    ( _´U`_ )    '--------------------------'
	    /___A___\
	     |  ~  |
	   __'.___.'__
	 ´   `  |° ´ Y `
	
	? What's the name of your application? notes
	? Enter name of the directory to contain the project: notes
	   create notes/
	     info change the working directory to hello-world
	
	? What kind of application do you have in mind?
	❯ notes (A project containing a basic working example, including a memory database)
	```
	
	This creates an application named `notes` in a directory of the same name. The application is a simple notes application which allows you to create, update, read and delete text notes. You will see a lot of messages printed to the command line window. It is creating a few resources for you and installing the various node modules. Once the node modules are loaded you'll notice that the process creates swagger and product definitions for you. Finally, the process displays some hints about what to do next. Since we've been given such lovely suggestions about what to do next, we may as well follow the first one at least.

1. Change directories to the project directory:
	
	```bash
	cd notes
	```

1. List the directory:

	```bash
	$ ls
	client  common  definitions  node_modules  package.json  server
	```
	
	If you're familiar with LoopBack or Node.js applications, some of the directories may be familiar to you. If not, here is a description of some of what is created.

|Directory or file|Description|
|-----------------|-----------|
|client|If the application has a front end, this is where the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc would be located. For our sample application there is only a stubbed out README.md.|
|common|Files common to both the server and the client application.|
|common/models|This sub-directory contains all the model JSON and JavaScript files. By model we're referring to a data model.|
|common/models/note.js|Custom script for the note data model. This file contains the implementation of the methods defined by the model definition file.|
|common/models/note.json|The note model definition file. This file contains the definition of the properties and methods for this model.|
|definitions|This directory contains the definitions for the APIs and the product contained in this application.|
|definitions/hello-world-product.yaml|YAML file for the the hello-world product. Which includes default plans for testing locally.|
|definitions/hello-world.yaml|Swagger definition file for the hello-world API. Includes information about the REST paths and operations, schemas for data models, security requirements, etc.|
|node_modules|Directory containing all the required node modules for the default application.|
|package.json|Standard Node.js package specification. Most importantly it contains the application package dependencies.|
|server|This directory contains the Node.js application and configuration files. We'll not look at them all in this tutorial, but here are a few.|
|server/server.js|The main appication script for this application. **Note:** this is defined in the package.json file.|
|server/config.json|This file contains the global application settings, such as REST API root, hostname and port.|
|server/model-config.json|This file binds models to data sources and specifies whether a model is exposed over REST, among other things.|
|server/datasources.json|This file is the data source configuration file.|

# 1.2	- Launching the `notes` Application

1. Now that we've explored what is created by the application generator, let's move on to the API Designer. From the command line:

	```bash
	apic edit
	```

1. To test our notes services, click on the `run` button located at the bottom left corner of the window to open the application launcher.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/run.png)
	
1. Once start completes, you should see a screen similar to this:
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/app-running.png)
	
	At this point we're ready to Explore and test our services.

	> ![][info]
	> 
	> We used the web-based editor to launch the application. There's also a command provided with the API Connect Developer Toolkit that can be utilized from the terminal to lauch the application: `apic start`

# 1.3	- Testing the `notes` Application

1. Click the `Explore` button to switch to the API Explorer view.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/explore.png)
	
	You will see all the exposed service paths displayed.
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/exploreScreen.png)
	
1. Now we're going to test the services using the GUI presented on the explore screen. You'll notice that on the left several REST services are defined for us. In particular, take a look `POST /notes` and `GET /notes`.

	If you're not familiar with GET and POST, they are HTTP methods (sometimes called verbs). The POST method is used for creation calls to the service. The GET method is used to retrieve information from a service. In this case, we see that both methods are used against the `/notes` path. So, POST will create a `note` and GET will retrieve all the `notes` that have been created.
	
1. Start by creating a couple of notes. Click the `POST /notes` link in the left column. The other columns will scroll so that you're looking at information and controls pertaining to the `POST /notes` service.

1. To test creation of a note, scroll down in the right hand column until the `Call operation` button is visible at the bottom. Just above the `Call operation` button you'll see a `Generate` link. This link will generate dummy data for you to create a test call to this service.

1. Press the `Generate` link to generate some sample data.
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/generate-data.png)
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/generate.png)
	
	Your data will look different, but you're ready to test the service.
	
1. Go ahead and press the `Call operation` button and scroll down to the `Response` section to see the results.
	
	> ![][troubleshooting]
	>
	> You may see an error displayed that mentions a CORS issue. This has to do with certificates in your browser. Go ahead an click the given link to rectify this, accept any certificate, close the opened tab, and press the `Call operation` button again.  Additionally, be sure not to skip step 5, as doing a `POST` operation without generating payload will cause an error.
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/CORS-support-error.png)
	
	In the results, you should see a `Code: 200 OK` which indicates that a new `note` was created. If you received a different response, see the troubleshooting steps below.
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/POST-results.png)
	
	> ![][troubleshooting]
  >
  > If you see a 500 error like the one below, make sure you press the `Generate` button before you press the `Call operation` button again. Otherwise, you're trying to create a duplicate note.
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/duplicateRecordError.png)

1. Once you have created one note, go ahead and create another one or two.

	> ![][info]
	> 
	> It should be noted that you don't need to use the `Generate` link. You can type data directly into the `Parameters`. You can also use `Generate` to create a template for you to use and then change the generated parameters. You may also notice that not all the parameters are always generated. This is because only the `title` parameter is required. Try pressing `Generate` several times to get a feel for how it works.
	
1. Finally, let's test the `GET /notes` service. We should have two, three, or more notes created at this point. In the left hand column click the `GET /notes` link.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/get-notes.png)

1. Scroll down to the `Call operation` button and press it. Then scroll down to the results.
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/GET-results.png)
		
	You should see all the notes that you generated in the result set.
		
	> ![][important]
	> 
	> If you see an empty array, `[]`, as your result, then you've not successfully created any notes. This is also true if you stop the application and restart it. With the hello-world example, we're using an in-memory database which means that nothing is persisted to disk. So, it is lost when the server is stopped and restarted. Lab 2 will walk through how to connect to your application to a persistent data source.

1. At this point, we are done testing the app locally. Click on the `Run` button again to return to the application launch screen.

1. Click on the `Stop` button to stop the application.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/stop-app.png)

# 1.4	- Prepare the API for Publishing

In the previous steps, you started the new application along with a MicroGateway locally on your developer work station. Our API Connect infrastructure uses DataPower as the gateway though, and not the MicroGateway. In order to publish the API definition to the API Connect servers, we'll need to change the Gateway Policies to utilize DataPower.

1. Click on the `APIs` option from the menu bar.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/apis-menu.png)

1. Click on the `notes` API from the list.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/notes-api.png)

1. Click on the `Assemble` option from the API menu bar.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/assemble-menu.png)

1. Click on the filter arrow to display the option to select the set of gateway policies and choose the option for `DataPower Gateway Policies`.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/select-dp-policies.png)

1. Click on the Save icon to save the API.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/save-api.png)

# 1.5	- Publishing the API to the Developer Portal

1. Click the `Publish` icon.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/publishButton.png)

1. Select `Add and Manage Targets` from the menu.

1. Select `Add a different target`.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/add-target.png)

1. Provide connection information to sign into the IBM API Connect management server, then click the `Sign in` button:

	> API Connect host address: `mgr.think.ibm`
	
	> Username: `student@think.ibm`
	
	> Password: `Passw0rd!`  
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/publish-target-signin.png)

1. On the "Select an organization and catalog" screen, choose the `Sandbox` catalog and click the `Next` button.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/publish-sandbox-catalog.png)

1. On the "Select an App" screen, choose `None` application and click the `Save` button.

	Our offline toolkit environment is now configured to speak to the central management server.

1. Click `Publish` button once more and select our target, indicated by the grey highlighting:

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/publish-target.png)

1. Here we have the opportunity to select what gets published. If we were working on multiple API products as part of this project, we could choose specific ones to publish.
	
	Also, the option exists to only Stage the product. A Stage-only action implies that we'll push the configuration to the Management server, but not actually make it available for consumption yet. The reason for doing this may be because your user permissions only allow staging, or that a different group is in charge of publishing Products.
	
	Click the `Publish` button:

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/publish-api.png)

1. Click the `Publish` button to make the API available in the Developer Portal.

1. Wait a moment while the Product is published, a Success message will appear letting you know the step is complete:

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/publish-success.png)

# 1.6	- Browsing the API in the Developer Portal

1. Open a new tab in the Firefox web browser by clicking on the new tab `+` button.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/new-tab.png)

1. A bookmark is already saved for the `Portal`, click on the bookmark to open the portal home page.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/portal-bookmark.png)

1. Click on the `API Products` link to see the available products published to the portal.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/api-products-link.png)

1. You should see the published `notes` API in the list of products.

  ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/publishedAPI.png)
  
  ```
	TODO: Update screenshot
	```

1. Close the `Firefox` web browser. If a warning is presented about closing multiple tabs, deselect the option to notify you in the future and click the `Close Tabs` button.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-onprem-docs/raw/5010/lab-guide/img/lab1/close-firefox.png)

1. In the terminal, use the `control+c` keyboard command to quit the API Designer program.
